# Knowledge Graphs and where to find them

## Session 1 - Introduction to the Organization of the Proseminar

### Content
Knowledge graphs are often the basis of data engineering in the field of artificial intelligence. To use knowledge graphs, one needs a variety of technologies, including knowledge about the creation, validation, and use of knowledge graphs by means of and in the natural language processing environment. After a general introduction to the technology, students will delve into a selected topic (see list of possible papers) and develop a short talk and blog post with poster on that topic.

You are welcome to present your own knowledge graph-based application or knowledge graph such as the Open Research Knowledge Graph, the Google KG, the Apple KG and so on. Before choosing an individual topic, please get approval by the course lead.

### Learning Goals
Students will be able to identify, evaluate and, if necessary, use current knowledge graphs and their areas of application. Students will have key skills in the area of independent research, structuring, presenting (blog, poster, presentation) and moderating a discussion following the presentation.

#### Presentation
- Presentation time 15 min plus 5 min for discussion in the proseminar.
- Slides can be in any format.
- The presentation should introduce the topic and put in relation to other works and its applicability.

#### Blog
- The blog post can be written in any format. We suggest markdown. 
- The blog post should be written for a general audience.
- The blog post can be published afterwards on https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/sems 

#### Poster
- The poster can be created in any file format but has to be A0 and portrait.
- The poster should not cover the whole topic but rather create interest to talk to the presenter about the topic.
- The poster is aimed at a general but academic audience.
- The poster will be printed by the SEMS staff afterwards and can be presented on the 4th floor of the F building if agreed.

### Timeline
Sessions are initially held weekly, then in blocks. All events take place synchronously online unless otherwise announced.
